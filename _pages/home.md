I am a linguistics PhD student at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, supervised by Marco Baroni (previous: MIT '20, MEng '21 in CSAIL Infolab). My interests lie in data compression as a signature of learnability and compositionality in humans and language models. I also dabble in emergent communication in humans and machines.

### News
- (September '24) New [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05771)! Intrinsic dimensionality of language model representations predicts LM-brain alignment very well.
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We know that middle layers from LLMs best predict brain responses to natural language. But why? In our new short paper (<a href="https://t.co/s5fBD9nl14">https://t.co/s5fBD9nl14</a>), we show that this prediction performance closely aligns with a peak in the âœ¨intrinsic dimensionalityâœ¨of the LLM&#39;s layers.
