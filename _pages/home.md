I am a linguistics PhD student at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain, supervised by Marco Baroni (previous: MIT '20, MEng '21 in CSAIL Infolab). My interests lie in data compression as a signature of learnability and compositionality in humans and language models. I also dabble in emergent communication in humans and machines.
